You are hereby granted the permission to:

* Use the software and any modifications made to it in any environment, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes.

2. **Conditions**
The following conditions must be met when redistributing the software, whether in original or modified form:
* The original copyright notice and the license text must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.
* If you distribute the software commercially, you must provide access to the original source code or a URL where the source code can be accessed.
* You are not required to release modified source code, except as required under the provision above.
* The software may be used privately or in closed-source applications, as long as the original source code is made available as specified.

3. **Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability**
The software is provided **"as is"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.
This includes but is not limited to any damages caused by modifications made to the software. The authors take no responsibility for any damages, losses, or issues arising from the use of the software, whether modified or unmodified, or from any of its derivatives. You agree to use the software at your own risk.

4. **Commercial Use**
* You may use the software in commercial applications, but must provide access to the original source code if the software is distributed commercially.
* You are allowed to modify the software and use the modified version for commercial purposes, but you are not required to distribute or make the modifications public.

5. **No Responsibility for Modified Versions**
* The authors take no responsibility for any modified versions of the software or any damages arising from the use of such modified versions. This applies to both the original and modified software, including but not limited to any defects, issues, or failures that may result from modifications made by others.
* The authors are not responsible for any loss of data, business disruption, or any other financial, personal, or professional loss arising from the use of the software, whether modified or unmodified.

6. **Termination**
This license will terminate automatically if you violate any of its terms. Upon termination, you must cease using, modifying, or distributing the software and any derived works.

7. **Patent License**
* Each contributor hereby grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the software, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such contributor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination of their contribution(s) with the software to which such contribution(s) was submitted.
* If you institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the software or a contribution incorporated within the software constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you under this license for that software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
* This patent license does not apply to combinations of the software with other software or hardware.

**Summary of Key Points:**
* Commercial use is allowed, with a requirement to make the original source code available.
* Modified code does not need to be shared, and commercial users can keep modifications closed-source.
* The software is provided "as-is," with no warranty or liability from the authors.
* The authors are not responsible for any damages arising from the software, whether original or modified.
* Contributors grant a patent license for their contributions but will revoke it if you initiate patent litigation.
